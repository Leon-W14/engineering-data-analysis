# Engineering Data Analysis & Visualisation (Python)

This repository contains a small Python-based analysis tool demonstrating an
engineering-style workflow for processing and visualising performance data.

## Overview
The notebook loads a structured dataset representing a simplified parameter
sweep over vehicle mass, tyre friction, and aerodynamic balance, and generates
derived metrics and plots to support performance sensitivity analysis.

## Notes
The data used is simplified and illustrative, intended to demonstrate analysis
workflow and tooling rather than provide predictive vehicle performance results.
